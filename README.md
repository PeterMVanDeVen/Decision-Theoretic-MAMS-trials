# Decision-Theoretic-MAMS-trials

R functions and annotated examples for 'Bayesian adaptive decision-theoretic multi-arm multi-stage clinical trials' by A. Bassi, J. Berkhof, D. de Jong & P.M. van de Ven.
We provide R code for the settings considered in the manuscript.

I) Selecting the best from three to five experimental arms

All functions to evaluate the operating characteristics of Bayesian-Adaptive Decision-Theoretic MAMS clinical trials in which the aim is to select the best from a set of three to five experimental arms are contained in the R script named 'Functions for selecting the best from three, four or five experimental arms.R'. The scripts 'Example code for selecting the best from three (resp. four, five) experimental arms.R' illustrate the use of these functions for settings considered in Simulation study I.

II) Comparison of two experimental arms to a control arm

All functions to evaluate the operating characteristics of Bayesian-Adaptive Decision-Theoretic MAMS clinical trials in which two experimental arms are compared to a control aarm are contained in the R script named 'Functions for comparing two experimental arms to a control arm.R'. The script 'Example code for comparing two experimental arms to a control arm.R' illustrates the use of these functions for settings considered in the practical example.
