# This script requires that the R script 'Functions for selecting the best from
# three, four or five experimental arms.R' was previously run and packages snow, 
# doSNOW and doParallel for parallel computing were installed.
# The required R script can be downloaded from 
# https://github.com/PeterMVanDeVen/Decision-Theoretic-MAMS-trials



# This example illustrates the use of the following functions for the 
# setting with three experimental arms: 
#
# create.d  : Simulates trial data
# prdrop    : Evaluates trials with adaptive stopping when arms can be dropped
# prnodrop  : Evaluates trials with adaptive stopping without dropping of arms
# reevaluate: Reevaluates trials using output from prdrop and prnodrop
#             for higher thresholds gamma (=C/Q) 
# pcalc     : Calculates operating characteristics (samples sizes and final decisions) 
#             using output from prdrop, prnodrop and reevaluate
#
# The required functions provided in a separate R script 'Functions for selecting the best from
# three, four or five experimental arms.R'
