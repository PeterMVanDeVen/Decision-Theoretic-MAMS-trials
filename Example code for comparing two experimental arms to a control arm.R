# The script requires that the R script 'Functions for comparing two experimental
# arms to a control arm.R' was previously run and packages snow, doSNOW and
# doParallel for parallel computing were installed.
# The required R script can be downloaded from 
# https://github.com/PeterMVanDeVen/Decision-Theoretic-MAMS-trials



# The script illustrates the use of the following functions for the 
# setting with two experimental arms and a control arm: 
# create.d      : Simulates trial data
# prsinglestage : Evaluates single-stage trials with fixed sample size and 
#                 final decision based on minimization of expected loss
# prdrop        : Evaluates trials with adaptive stopping when arms can be dropped
# prnodrop      : Evaluates trials with adaptive stopping without dropping of arms
# reevaluate    : Reevaluates trials using output from prdrop and prnodrop 
#                 for higher thresholds gamma (=C/Q) 
# pcalc         : Calculates operating characteristics (samples sizes and final decisions) 
#                 using output from prdrop, prnodrop and reevaluate
